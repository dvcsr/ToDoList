This is the *To-Do List (JavaScript)* project I made myself.

In this project, I managed to successfully implement:
- Design your to-do list web page. Set CSS styles
- Add new tasks to the list and remove them if they are no longer needed.
- Work with checkboxes to mark tasks as complete and manage dynamic styles.
- Store tasks in the local storage to keep them when the page is reloaded.
